# 1. Lipinski’s Rule of Five (Ro5, 1997)

# Goal: Estimate likelihood of good oral bioavailability.

# Cutoffs (compounds tend to fail if 2 or more are violated):

# MW ≤ 500 Da

# logP ≤ 5

# H-bond donors ≤ 5

# H-bond acceptors ≤ 10

# Logic: Absorption/permeability decreases when these properties are exceeded.

# Limitation: Not predictive of all oral drugs; exceptions exist (antibiotics, natural products).

# 2. Veber’s Rules (2002)

# Goal: Refine oral bioavailability prediction.

# Cutoffs:

# Rotatable bonds ≤ 10

# Polar surface area (TPSA) ≤ 140 Å²

# Logic: Fewer rotatable bonds = less conformational flexibility → better passive absorption.

# Complement: Often applied with Ro5.

# 3. Ghose Filter (1999)

# Goal: Define “drug-like chemical space.”

# Cutoffs:

# MW: 160–480

# logP: −0.4 to +5.6

# Molar refractivity: 40–130

# Atom count: 20–70

# Logic: Combines lipophilicity, size, and polarizability.

# Application: Early screening libraries.

# 4. Egan’s Filter (2000)

# Goal: Predict passive permeability and oral absorption.

# Cutoffs:

# logP ≤ 5.88

# TPSA ≤ 131 Å²

# Logic: Plotting logP vs TPSA defines an “absorption ellipse.”

# Usage: Quick oral absorption check.

# 5. Muegge Filter (2001)

# Goal: General drug-likeness filter (implemented in “Druglikeness Rules”).

# Cutoffs:

# MW: 200–600

# logP: −2 to 5

# TPSA ≤ 150 Å²

# Rotatable bonds ≤ 15

# HBD ≤ 5, HBA ≤ 10

# Logic: Broader ranges than Ro5; excludes very small or very large molecules.

# 6. Pfizer’s 3/75 Rule (2001, internal attrition analysis)

# Goal: Identify compounds prone to safety attrition.

# Cutoffs:

# logD (at pH 7.4) > 3

# TPSA < 75 Å²

# Logic: High lipophilicity + low polarity = higher risk of hERG binding, poor clearance.

# 7. GSK’s 4/400 Rule (GlaxoSmithKline)

# Goal: Improve CNS drug quality.

# Cutoffs:

# H-bond donors ≤ 4

# MW ≤ 400 Da

# Logic: Lower MW and fewer donors = better brain penetration.

# 8. Golden Triangle (Gleeson, 2008)

# Goal: Define “sweet spot” for potency and ADMET.

# Optimal window:

# logD: −0.5 to 4.5

# MW: 200–500 Da

# Logic: Plotted as a triangle on MW vs logD chart — hits outside triangle are less likely to progress.
